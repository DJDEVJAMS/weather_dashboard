# Weather Dashboard

## Description

This Weather Dashboard is a simple web application that allows users to search for weather information by city. It provides both the current weather and a 5-day forecast, displaying data such as temperature, wind speed, and humidity. The app stores a search history using `localStorage`, so users can quickly revisit cities theyâ€™ve previously searched for.
